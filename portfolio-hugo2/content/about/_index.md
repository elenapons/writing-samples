From a young age, I have always had a passion for learning. I did not always like going to school, but I did love songs as a means to understand the world around me, even before I could read.

As I grew older, I believed that staying in school was the only way to continue my learning journey. This led me to musicology, which offered a perfect blend of insight and creativity and kept me motivated. After earning my bachelor's degree, I moved to the UK to pursue a master's and PhD in musicology. My time there was spent researching, writing, and teaching, which deepened my appreciation for knowledge.

In an effort to widen the scope of my [PhD research](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/en/publications/arranging-the-canon-keyboard-arrangements-publishing-practices-an), I discovered the potential of software technology. Intrigued by its possibilities, I began taking online courses and found that software development was not only accessible but also offered endless opportunities for learning.

After completing my PhD, my goals shifted. I was drawn to a career as a software technical writer, where I could leverage my writing and teaching skills to simplify complex technical concepts for a broader audience. Combining my expertise in writing with my new passion for technology and software development was a natural fit.

My specialties include rapidly acquiring new skills and tools, using Git/GitHub, Asciidoc/Antora, problem-solving, and documenting Kubernetes-based distributed systems. I am also an advocate for the Diataxis framework and have recently built my own [portfolio website using Hugo](https://epons.tech/).
